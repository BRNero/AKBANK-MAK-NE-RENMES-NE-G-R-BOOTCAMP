##Introduction 

**Dataset info

This dataset focuses on lung cancer mortality and provides an extensive collection of patient records centered on individuals diagnosed with cancer. It is structured to support the examination of multiple factors that could impact cancer outcomes and treatment effectiveness. The dataset encompasses a variety of demographic, clinical, and treatment-related attributes, offering a detailed view of each patient's health background and condition.

The purpose

I aimed to predict the survival outcome using features from my dataset, with the target variable being whether a patient survived or not.

Before running any machine learning models, I performed data wrangling to clean and prepare the data. I experimented with several models, but most achieved an accuracy of around 0.50, which suggests that this dataset may not be well-suited for supervised machine learning.

Additionally, data quality issues might be impacting performance, so further validation of data integrity is needed. As a next step, I plan to explore unsupervised learning techniques to uncover potential patterns or insights without relying on labels.
